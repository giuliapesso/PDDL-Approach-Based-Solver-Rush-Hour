# Parameters: problem -> file problem
# The variable file is used to store the plan file returned by the solver for the specified problem file.
# The plan file is then opened in order to be read.
# From the plan file's lines we remove the parentheses, and we split the lines into their elements, which are:
# - rSplit[1] = name of the vehicle to be moved
# - rSplit[2] = coordinate that doesn't change during the movement
# - rSPlit[-1] = last element of the line, that indicates the coordinate where the vehicle is moving to 
# We add these elements to the array that contains all the plan actions, called movesPddl. 
# For each move contained in movesPddl, we assign the variables xDest and yDest to the right value.
# Return: moves -> list of moves to be executed
