# Parameters: file -> the problem file
# The problem file is read in order to extract the dimension of the game board. 
# To do this, we take all the declared coordinates inside the problem file, we remove "x" and "y" from their variables names,
# and then we take the maximum of the found numbers as the board dimension.
# Return: the maximum of the found numbers

# Parameters: file -> the problem file
# This method is used to obtained the positions where all the problem vehicles are located.
# We read the file until the "goal" section is reached.
# We find all the lines in which appears the predicate that starts with "at". 
# To these lines, "at" is removed and they are splits into their elements, which are: vehicle name, x coordinate, y coordinate.
# For each found lines we define:
# - name = variable that stores the name of the vehicle specified 
# - row = variable that stores the x coordinate specified in the problem minus 1 in order to start from 0
# - col = variable that stores the y coordinate specified in the problem minus 1 in order to start from 0
# We check if a vehicle called "name" exists in the list of declared vehicles from class Vehicle:
# - if it returns true, then the new couple of (x,y) coordinates is added to the list of coordinates for that vehicle;
# - if it returns false, then the new vehicle is added to vehicles, and also its coordinate. 
# Return: vehicles -> list of vehicles
